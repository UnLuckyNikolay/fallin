Refactors:

Enemy shouldn't be deleted on death so it doesn't immediately drop loot
Write* methods should instead return menus as strings so it can be written right after clearing screen

Features:

Structures
Fog of war
Borders for menus

Old list:

// DONE --- Possibly remove player.location, only use Game_old.characterLocation
// Maybe change it so SPECIAL scale with level (calculated in .CalculateStats) for monsters and then command would be Character_old("name", level)
// DONE --- Try: change map so each row is another array so there is no need to have movement array. Would be easier to have different sizes, including non-square
// DONE --- Rewrite Special back to names instead of an array to fuck my own brains less
// DONE --- Finish rewritig DrawMap block (change all usages to v2), change code for movement
// DONE --- Add Move block that can be used by player (with up/down etc) and enemies (random, maybe towards player)
// DONE --- Add time to dots
// DONE --- Possibly one big blok for commands that would give ability to have test commands
// DONE --- Colored text?
// DONE --- Change health to int, round attack
// Merchant, charisma
// Command/block for level generation
// Exit
// DONE --- Legend for map and special
// DONE --- Dead enemies
// DONE --- Battle pass and name color customisation
// Inventory and drop tables
// DONE --- Game_old restart is broken
// DONE --- Maybe min and max damage
// DONE --- Add second unpopulated copy of the map and change movement to allow exit/merchant/etc
// Enemy movement
// Maybe fog of war
// DONE --- Attack cheat doesn't remove enemy from the map
// Split Character_old into Player and NPC

// add class Item
// maybe a list of items as inventory
// inventory as a list of [id, amount]?
